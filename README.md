# Muppet Show Creator

This is a basic webapp that lets you simulate creating a muppet show, and adding Muppets to said show. You can have multiple shows with many different Muppets, log in with your Github, and see all users shows organized by date.


### Prerequisites

This was written with Ruby 2.6.1, and Ruby on Rails. 

### Installing
    
Copy the code of this repo.

In your terminal:

    git clone "paste-github-repo-code"

Go to the first level directory that contains all of the repo's folders, and run this:

    bundle install #this will install any necessary gems

After bundle install is complete, you'll want to start the Rails server and visit the webpage. To start, input:

    rails s

Then, on your web browser of choice, go to localhost:3000. You don't need www. or .com. 

You're ready to sign in and get the show going!
